It is considered as the largest Iranian company in terms of annual income with a revenue of 364 657 billion Rials in 2016. It is the largest bank in the Islamic world and in the Middle East. In this project, TiaraUXD company was asked to perform a set of usability tests for BAAM’s website and application inorder to figure out why the bank’s customers don’t use this online system.</p></div><div class="about-baam_image__22dAu"><img src="/images/baam/baam-about.png"/></div></div><div class="two-col_container__ev2wD"><h2 class="styles_heading__J2XLh styles_heading-2__2QnGi">My Roles And Responsibilities</h2><div class="two-col_body__3Xpse"><div class="two-col_col__3lL_K"><h3 class="two-col_colTitle__HOyiN">UX Researcher</h3><p class="two-col_colParagraph__3GXgk">As a member of a team, I was involved in the entire process of conducting the test.

To do so, we had to write a reasonable story and ask the participants to do the tasks using account information that we gave them. This issue was problematic specially in those tasks that participants needed to enter some information, like the username and password, card number etc.</div></li><li class="baam-challenges_item__35b7q"><div class="baam-challenges_itemTitle__1xvME">Lab Usability Test Environment</div><div class="baam-challenges_itemDescription__HyeFM">The participants in a lab usability test are always aware of being observed, which affects their normal functionality, especially if they are older. Occasionally in the test, it happened that a participant made a simple mistake and was unable to perform the tasks they had just completed. And as the facilitator, it was my job to keep them back on track again reassuring them that they’re doing fine.</div></li><li class="baam-challenges_item__35b7q"><div class="baam-challenges_itemTitle__1xvME">Detecting the Main Usability Issues in a Qualitative Test</div><div class="baam-challenges_itemDescription__HyeFM">In lab usability testing, getting an accurate answer to &quot;why&quot; a participant cannot do a task is another challenge. Analyzing all the data from observing the test sessions and comparing it with what was recorded, we were able to discern what causes each task to fail. It&#x27;s important for UX researchers to consider all the factors affecting participants&#x27; behavior.</div></li></ul></div></div><div class="baam-wwd_container__1mjds"><div class="baam-wwd_body__34Sy0"><h2 class="baam-wwd_heading__3uyV0 styles_heading__J2XLh styles_heading-2__2QnGi">WHAT WE DID</h2><ul class="baam-wwd_list__3B4zP"><li class="baam-wwd_item__2qBZQ"><div class="baam-wwd_itemTitle__2R7E0">Expert Review</div><div class="baam-wwd_itemDescription__1WPqP">First of all, we held an expert review session among the team to determine as many usability issues as possible.

Since it was an online banking system with actual money transactions, there were a lot of bottlenecks throughout the process, and we had to cross-check the script with the client almost every step of the way.ited.</div></li></ul></div></div><div class="baam-results_container__1ERKG"><div class="baam-results_body__3_pZu"><h2 class="baam-results_heading__3xFMi styles_heading__J2XLh styles_heading-2__2QnGi">Results</h2><ul class="baam-results_list__1w7SW"><li class="baam-results_item__w8fLb"><p class="baam-results_itemDescription__25zri">We reviewed and analyzed the quantitative and qualitative data and prepared a final report for our client. Usability issues were classified in two main sections in this report: user interface related issues such as inconsistent primary buttons, and user experience related issues such as unclear error messages and button labels. It was interesting to see how small things like changing the keyboard&#x27;s language can lead to confusing older users, resulting in them abandoning the product. The test was organized for one of Iran&#x27;s largest banks, and because of the NDA I am not allowed to disclose furthure details about it.</p></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class="styles_footer__3wl8P"><div class="styles_motto__SEEay"><pre></pre></div></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/case-studies/baam","query":{},"buildId":"Sm0qLFLYrHFGIesCTWzig","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-f8d88fc6aa27b790f2ac.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-1cbb100e4b61c5ef024f.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.ba2bf8d098bdfcabce6f.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.5efcffce934b1bd07e3c.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-6e4dfb476efc98b3d104.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/b58236aa7cea598bf20a3f767c1c2fac45845e76.e64f3d6185bba44ca1e0.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/case-studies/baam-a915f9d96cf56292263a.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/Sm0qLFLYrHFGIesCTWzig/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/Sm0qLFLYrHFGIesCTWzig/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
